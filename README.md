# vibecoding

VibeCoding is an open experiment in crowd-driven software development powered by AI.

Anyone can submit project ideas or features as GitHub issues. The community votes on them, and every night at 12:00 UTC, an AI coding agent (Claude) picks the top-ranked issue, implements it, and pushes working code to the repository. This runs continuously, turning GitHub into a living lab for autonomous software building.

The project explores what happens when human creativity, social prioritization, and AI execution combine — while actively experimenting with safety, governance, and abuse prevention in autonomous coding workflows.
