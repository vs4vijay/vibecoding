# vibecoding

**VibeCoding** is an open experiment in crowd-driven software development powered by AI.

Anyone can submit project ideas or features as GitHub issues, and the community votes on them. I have a coding agent (Claude) monitoring this repo — every night at 12:00 UTC, it picks the top-ranked issue, implements it, and pushes working code to the repository. This runs continuously, turning GitHub into a living lab for autonomous software building.

The project explores what happens when human creativity, social prioritization, and AI execution come together, while actively experimenting with safety, governance, and abuse prevention in autonomous coding workflows.
